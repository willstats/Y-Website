# Geodesic Y Website

## Welcome!

During my internship at the University of Alberta in the Department of Computing Science, I made this website to showcase my group's research regarding the board game Y. You can think of it as an online poster representation!

Further, Ahmed Siad-Omar has created an interactive JavaScript version of the game [here](https://ahmedsiad.github.io/Geodesic-Y/). Go check it out!
